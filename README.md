# README

To build and install for testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bryceml/epsxe-snap
cd epsxe-snap
snapcraft
sudo snap install --devmode --dangerous *.snap
```

It appears that https://github.com/ahimta/epsxe-tools is making a lot more
progress than this project, so I don't plan on continuing this project.  You
should probably use https://github.com/ahimta/epsxe-tools instead.
